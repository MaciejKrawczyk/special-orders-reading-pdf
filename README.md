# special-orders-reading-pdf
## About
This is a project of an API/class for polish production company that produces gold wedding rings. 
## Detailed description
The customer sends us the .pdf file consisting of crucial information about the part we need to make. The goal of this project was to create an API that gets information from the pdf and then use this information later in creating production paths for this specific order, automating processes and sending order to stelmach-production-site [(link to my repo)](https://github.com/MaciejKrawczyk/stelmach_production_site). Work in progress.
